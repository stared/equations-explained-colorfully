## Equation

$$
\mark[ricci]{R_{\mu\nu}} \mark[scalar]{- \frac{1}{2}R g_{\mu\nu}} + \mark[dark-energy]{\Lambda g_{\mu\nu}} = \mark[coupling]{\frac{8\pi G}{c^4}} \mark[matter]{T_{\mu\nu}}

## Description

The [Ricci curvature]{.ricci} and [scalar curvature]{.scalar} combined with [dark energy]{.dark-energy} are determined by the [matter distribution]{.matter} scaled by the [gravitational constant]{.coupling}.

## .ricci

Ricci Curvature Tensor ($R_{\mu\nu}$).

This describes how the volume of a shape changes as it moves through spacetime. It represents the part of curvature that causes matter to converge or diverge, directly corresponding to the presence of mass and energy.

## .scalar

Scalar Curvature Term ($-\frac{1}{2}R g_{\mu\nu}$).

This geometric correction involves the Ricci scalar $R$ and metric tensor $g_{\mu\nu}$. It ensures that the geometry side of the equation mathematically conserves energy and momentum, matching the physics of the matter side.

## .dark-energy

The Cosmological Constant ($\Lambda$).

An intrinsic energy of empty space that pushes the universe apart. It opposes gravity and is responsible for the accelerating expansion of the universe.

## .coupling

Gravitational Coupling.

This tiny factor ($\approx 2 \times 10^{-43}$) describes how "stiff" spacetime is. It explains why gravity is so weak: it takes a massive amount of matter (like the Earth) to produce even a modest curvature.

## .matter

Stress-Energy Tensor ($T_{\mu\nu}$).

The source of gravity. It tells space how to curve using mass density ($\rho$), pressure ($p$), and momentum flux. In General Relativity, all energy gravitates, not just mass.
