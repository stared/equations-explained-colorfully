# New Equation

## Equation

$$
\mark[energy]{E} = \mark[mass]{m}\mark[light]{c^2}
$$

## Description

[Energy]{.energy} equals [mass]{.mass} times the [speed of light squared]{.light}.

## .energy

Energy of an object at rest.

Edit this equation to create your own! The syntax is `\mark[label]{displayed content}` where `label` is used for coloring and references, and `displayed content` is what appears in the equation.

## .mass

Rest mass of the object.

## .light

The speed of light squared (c²).

Reference terms in descriptions using `[text]{.label}` where `label` matches the one used in `\mark[label]{...}`.
