# Euler's Identity

## Equation

$$
\mark[exponential]{e}^{\mark[imaginary]{i}\mark[pi]{\pi}} + \mark[one]{1} = \mark[zero]{0}
$$

## Description

[Euler's number]{.exponential} raised to [the imaginary unit]{.imaginary} times [pi]{.pi}, plus [one]{.one}, equals [zero]{.zero}.

## .exponential

Euler's number $e \approx 2.71828$ is the base of natural logarithms.

It appears everywhere in mathematics: compound interest, population growth, radioactive decay, and probability distributions. It's defined as the limit of $(1 + 1/n)^n$ as $n$ approaches infinity.

## .imaginary

The imaginary unit $i = \sqrt{-1}$ extends the real numbers to complex numbers.

When combined with exponentials, $i$ creates rotation in the complex plane. The expression $e^{i\theta}$ traces out a unit circle as $\theta$ varies.

## .pi

The mathematical constant $\pi \approx 3.14159$ is the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter.

In this formula, $\pi$ represents a half-rotation around the unit circle in the complex plane.

## .one

The number 1 is the multiplicative identity.

Adding 1 to $e^{i\pi} = -1$ brings us to zero, completing this remarkable relationship.

## .zero

Zero is the additive identity and represents nothingness.

This identity connects five of mathematics' most important numbers in a single, elegant equation that Richard Feynman called "the most remarkable formula in mathematics."
