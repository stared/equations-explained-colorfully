## Description

[How the wave changes]{.timederiv}, scaled by the [imaginary unit]{.imaginary} and the [Planck constant]{.planck}, equals ([energy from motion]{.kinetic} from [spatial curvature]{.spatial} + [energy from position]{.potential}) acting on [the quantum wave]{.wavefunction}.

## .imaginary

Indicates the quantum nature of the equation and ensures unitary time evolution. The imaginary unit $i$ is fundamental to quantum mechanics, distinguishing it from classical physics.

## .planck

Fundamental constant connecting energy and frequency.

**Value:** $\hbar \approx 1.055 \times 10^{-34}$ J·s

This reduced Planck constant sets the scale for quantum effects.

## .timederiv

Rate of change of the wavefunction with respect to time.

This derivative tells us how the quantum state evolves as time progresses.

## .kinetic

Kinetic energy operator coefficient, where $m$ is the particle mass.

The factor $-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}$ appears in the kinetic energy term of the Hamiltonian.

## .spatial

Second derivative describing spatial curvature of the wavefunction (Laplacian).

Higher curvature corresponds to higher kinetic energy, reflecting the wave-like nature of quantum particles.

## .potential

External potential energy as a function of position.

$V(x)$ represents forces acting on the particle, such as electromagnetic fields or gravitational wells.

## .wavefunction

Complex-valued quantum state describing the particle.

The wavefunction $\psi$ contains all information about the quantum system's state. Its absolute square gives the probability density.
